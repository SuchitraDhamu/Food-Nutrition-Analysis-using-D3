# Food-Nutrition-Analysis-using-D3

How to run the code:
I used easyPHP to run the code on local server. For this, I followed the below steps:
1. Download easyPHP devserver 17 and install it on the system.
2. Run the application as an administrator and then hit the icon to open the dashboard.
3. Once the dashboard opens on 'http://127.0.0.1:1111/', create a working directory with a path of folder where all the files are saved.
4. Start the HTTP Server and click on the directory to view the files.
5. Select the project.html file.
6. This will open the file on the browser and show all the interactions.


////	Other things to note:
//	I wrote the D3 code adhering to version 7 and used Chrome browser to generate my visualizations.
